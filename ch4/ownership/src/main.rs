fn main() { // Variable scope starts here.

    // Stack vs. Heap.
    // - Stack is for fixed values known at compile time, and is managed `last in, first out`.
    // - Heap is for values with unknown size, and involves book keeping to manage (pointers, allocation, freeing)
    // - Memory management techniques:
    //   - Garbage Collection. Program automatically looks for unused memory and frees it. (Inefficient!).
    //   - Manual. Programmers explicitly allocate and free memory in their code. (Error prone!)
    //   - Rust = Ownership. A set of ownership rules managed at compile time.

    // String literals are immutable. Memory is allocated at compile time and embedded in the binary.
    let s = "hello";
    println!("{}", s);

    // String types are different. Data is allocated on the heap so that it can be modified at runtime.
    // Memory is automatically allocated on initialization, and dropped when the variable goes out of scope.
    // In C++ this is called Resource Acquisition is Initialization (RAII)
    let mut s = String::from("hello");
    s.push_str(", world!");
    println!("{}", s);

    // Ways that variables and data interact: Move

    // Simple data types are managed on the stack, so this is really just a value copy.
    let x = 5;
    let y = x;
    println!("x: {}, y: {}", x, y);

    // Complex data types are different!
    // Rust only allows *one* owner at a time.

    let s1 = String::from("hello"); // s1 owns this value
    let s2 = s1; // s2 takes over ownership
    println!("s2: {}", s2);

    // not allowed! only one owner per heap reference at any given time.
    // println!("s1: {}", s1);
    //                    ^^ value borrowed here after move

    // Shallow vs. Deep copying
    // - Shallow. Just copy pointer.
    // - Deep. Copy values.
    // Rust = No deep copies, courtesy of ownership.

    // Ways that variables and data interact: clone
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1.clone();

    // now this is legal!
    println!("s1: {}", s1);
    println!("s2: {}", s2);

    // Ownership and Functions.
    let i1 = 5;
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    // allowed...
    println!("{}", i1);
    println!("{}", s1);

    take_ownership(s1);
    make_copy(i1);

    // still allowed...
    println!("{}", i1);

    // no longer allowed! the function has taken over ownership of the value previously refered to by s
    // and Rust has therefore invalidated s.
    // println!("{}", s1);
    println!("{}", s2);

    let s1 = gives_ownership();
    println!("{}", s1);
    let s2 = takes_and_gives_ownership(s1);
    // println!("{}", s1);
    //                ^^ value borroed here after move
    println!("{}", s2);

    // while this is safe, it's also tedious to always pass back a value so you can use it afterwards.
    let s = String::from("hello");
    let (s, len) = calculate_length(s);
    println!("String: {} Length: {}", s, len);

    // we can avoid this by passing values by reference, which bypasses ownership rules.
    // Rust calls this pattern (reference as function parameters) "borrowing"
    let s = String::from("hello");
    let len = calculate_length_by_ref(&s);
    println!("String: {} Length: {}", s, len);

    // what if we want to modify a value passed by reference? use a mutable reference!
    let mut s = String::from("hello"); // initial variable is a mut String
    change(&mut s); // function must accept a &mut String
    println!("{}", s);

    // one big restriction here -- there can only be 1 mutable reference in any given scope.
    let mut s = String::from("hello");
    let m1 = &mut s;
    // let m2 = &mut s;
    //          ^^^^^^ second mutable borrow occurs here 
    // println!("{}, {}", m1, m2);
    //                    -- first borrow later used here

    // Major benefit -- Rust can prevent data race conditions at compile time! ðŸ˜²

    // Note -- you can have as many immutable references as you want, as there's no risk of data being changed.
    let s = String::from("Hello");
    let s1 = &s;
    let s2 = &s;
    println!("perfectly legal! {}, {}", s1, s2);

    // Occurs when there's a pointer to a memory location that was freed elsewhere. Not possible in Rust.
    // let s = dangle();
    let s = no_dangle();
    println!("no dangle! {}", s);
